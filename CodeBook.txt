Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course Project


Explanations

The original data was modifies by;

Merging the Test and Train data sets together to create one data set.

Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.

Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Descriptions and Identifiers

The first two columns (Subject and Activity) are Identifiers.

Subject

Subject: the ID of the Subject

Activity

Activity: the Name of the Activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken

Measurements

As mentioned above,the variables remaining are just the calculated means and standard deviations of the data sets.

Below are the traits name used as it's in the feature file.
